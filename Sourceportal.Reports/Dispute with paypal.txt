	Good afternoon. This issue is in regards to Transaction: 
7CC34512FC9568359. You have attempted a charge on my USAA 
account for the third time. Your system attempts 3 retries when 
insufficient funds are present. This is because you tried the wrong 
account. MY chase or paypal credit would have been sufficient. Let 
me be one of the many to say that your 3-try system is the WORST 
system I have ever come across. It does not make sense to retry 
an account 3 times and rack up 3 NSF FEES! This is embarrassing 
for Paypal to call this professional.  I have put a stop on my banks 
end to prevent your careless attempts to collect 3 consecutive 
times. However it seems your system has not honored this and has 
retried charged me AGAIN, thus leaving me with another NSF fee 
from my bank.
Since you have ignored a stop you will refund 29 dollars 
immediately or I will close all accounts with you and file a class 
action law suit so you can answer to me and all others who has 
been inconvenienced by this. I have paid every NSF fee(x3) you 
have thrown at me for over 10 years, despite your haphazard retry 
system and this is where I draw the line.
I have tried to dispute this transaction within your system, however 
your system is having issues disputing the exact transaction 
(7CC34512FC9568359). The exact error I receive is "Lets try that again, something 
went wrong on our end". Since you have technical faults
regarding your dispute system and I am unable to make a proper 
dispute as Paypal's terms dictate I should, your are in breech of this 
agreement. Screenshots have been taken of my bank statement, 
and the error page your system has returned and will be included in 
my suit against Paypal should this not be resolved within 72 hours. I will take legal action. Good day.
